# End-to-End Business Flow

This document describes how Lucien2026 operates as a business system from first contact to delivered revenue.

---

## 1. Entry Points

There are three primary entry vectors:

1. Marketplace (anonymous or logged-in)
2. Direct Inquiry (Request Scope)
3. Partners & Experts intake

All three converge into the same internal pipeline.

---

## 2. Marketplace → Intake → Scope

1. User browses Marketplace (24 service packages).
2. Optional AI-assisted Intake:
   - User describes problem.
   - System extracts signals (tags, urgency, constraints).
   - System recommends service packages.
3. User proceeds to Request Scope:
   - Intake summary is prefilled.
   - Selected services are attached.
4. Scope Proposal is created (paid).

---

## 3. Scope → Engagement

1. Scope is accepted and paid.
2. Engagement is created.
3. Engagement defines:
   - Terms
   - Delivery tasks
   - Staffing needs
4. HR/Talent pipeline is activated if needed.

---

## 4. Delivery → Revenue

1. Time entries, milestones, or fixed fees are tracked.
2. Invoices are generated.
3. Revenue is realized.
4. Engagement closes or expands.

---

## 5. Feedback Loops

- Intake data feeds future recommendations.
- Engagement outcomes feed staffing heuristics.
- Talent performance feeds future matching.

This creates a compounding system, not linear consulting.
