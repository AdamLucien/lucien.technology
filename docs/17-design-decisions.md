# Design Decisions & Rationale

This document explains WHY Lucien2026 is designed this way.

---

## 1. Marketplace First

Services are explicit, priced, and constrained.
This avoids infinite custom consulting.

---

## 2. Paid Scoping

Scope is a product.
It filters unserious clients and funds discovery.

---

## 3. AI as Assistive Layer

AI never:
- Commits delivery
- Sets price
- Assigns people

It assists human decision-making only.

---

## 4. Talent as Strategic Asset

Talent is:
- Not staff
- Not marketplace freelancers
- A curated, semi-private pool

---

## 5. Control Room Philosophy

Transparency builds trust with advanced users,
but is optional and collapsible.

---

## 6. Enterprise Bias

Every decision favors:
- Auditability
- Predictability
- Controlled growth

This system is designed to scale without chaos.
